This is the content of the Bachelors Thesis.
For a better understanding of the content I suggest the following order of viewing the documents:
  1) Bachelors Thesis Presentation.pptx
  2) Bachelors Thesis.docx
  3) Application_Flow.html
  4) Demo_fin.flv
The rest of the files have the following meaning:
  1) "wall detection.zip" is the java code that I used to identify the walls in the building.
  2) "poze-root.zip" are the results of the algorithm from wall detection and they should be loaded on the android device
  3) "Pin-map-next-2.zip" is the android code that represents the application project
